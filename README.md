# PhD course on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

This is the reference page 
for the PhD course titled 
  **"Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning"** 
delivered by [Dott. Stefano Mariani](https://smarianimore.github.io/) 
for the PhD program [Industrial Innovation Engineering](http://www.iii.unimore.it/site/home.html) 
offered by the [University of Modena and Reggio Emilia](https://www.unimore.it/it). 

# Organisation

The course is 12 hours (3 ETCS) long 
and is scheduled for late October 2024:
 - Wednesday   **23/10/2024**,  14:00 - 18:00
 - Friday  **25/10/2024**,  10:00 - 14:00
 - Wednesday  **30/10/2024**,  14:00 - 18:00

Lectures will be in two locations 
(close to each other, both in **Reggio Emilia, San Lazzaro Campus**):
 - on both Wednesdays, 23rd and 30th:   **room F1.3** of the [Buccola-Bisi Pavillion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B7RUghyqtGYQMbc69)
 - on Friday, 25th:  **lab G1.2** of the [Tamburini Pavillion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/88nZ1KWApgovJiuY9)

You are *not required* to bring with you your own laptop 
to do exercises or follow along, 
but can of course bring it 
to take notes and browse slides yourself.

**Remote participation IS NOT ALLOWED**, 
except for exceptional circumstances that should be motivated and agreed upon with me.

# Syllabus

I do not assume *any background knowledge* of 
game theory, 
Reinforcement Learning (RL) 
or Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), 
nor obviously of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). 

The course is meant to provide attendants 
with basic knowledge about 
concepts, techniques, and technologies 
used specifically in MARL. 
To do so, introducing concepts of RL and game theory 
is a necessary prerequisite. 
At the end of the course, 
attendants **are not** expected to be proficient 
in modelling, solving, and analysing performance 
of RL and/or MARL problems. 
However, attendants are expected to 
**understand the terminology** 
and whether RL and/or MARL can provide solutions to their own research problems. 
This way, attendants become able to 
**autonomously carry out further research** 
to expand their knowledge of RL and MARL, 
as applied to their own research field.

Lectures will cover the following topics:
 - the basics of RL
 - from RL to MARL
 - roots in game theory
 - solution concepts
 - learning (computing solutions)
 - deep MARL in brief
 - communication in MARL
 - software libraries

# Material

Course slides are available [here]().

Code examples are available in [this repository](https://github.com/smarianimore/2023-dai-marl-lab). 
 
The content of the slides is assembled from different sources, 
but the most relevant one is the [MARL book](https://www.marl-book.com/), 
**digitally available free of charge** 
 (in pdf form). 
The book comes with slides 
and code examples, too. 

# Exam

Attendants are expected to take a final examination to earn the course ETCS. 
Such an exam may consist of: 
 1. a small software project
 2. a brief essay
 3. an oral quiz

The examination is **individual by default**, 
however, for the small project solely, 
I can consider letting you work in a team. 
[Send me an email](mailto:stefano.mariani@unimore.it) in case.

There are no scheduled dates to take the examination: 
[Send me an email](mailto:stefano.mariani@unimore.it) to 
agree on the kind of exam you wish to take (before starting to study) 
and schedule the exam date (when finished). 

The numbering besides exam kinds is not accidental: 
it is a preference order. 
It is in **your best interest** to 
try a small software project, 
if you can (e.g. have a programming background). 
It is in your best interest to 
try to apply RL or MARL in your research field, 
if there seem to be potential benefits. 

The **small software project** is meant to be 
a low-complexity project 
not meant to showcase optimal results, 
but your ability to properly set up an RL or MARL experiment. 
As a rule of thumb, 
it is sufficient that the project "size" 
is similar to the course code examples. 

The **brief essay** is meant to 
assess your ability to frame one or more problems 
in your current research field 
as RL or MARL problems, 
conceptually. 
This includes properly defining the RL or MARL problem 
in all its constituent parts: 
 - game-theoretic reference formulation, 
 - observation space 
 - action space 
 - reward function 
 - RL algorithm 
 - learning setting 
 - experimental methodology 
 - evaluation metrics 

The oral quiz is meant to 
assess your understanding of the course topics. 
More details will come.
