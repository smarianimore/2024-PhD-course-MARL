# PhD course on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

This is the reference page 
for the PhD course titled 
  **"Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning"** 
delivered by [Dott. Stefano Mariani](https://smarianimore.github.io/) 
for the PhD program [Industrial Innovation Engineering](http://www.iii.unimore.it/site/home.html) 
offered by the [University of Modena and Reggio Emilia](https://www.unimore.it/it). 

# Organisation

The course is 12 hours (3 ETCS) long 
and is scheduled for late October 2024:
 - Wednesday   **23/10/2024**,  14:00 - 18:00
 - Friday  **25/10/2024**,  10:00 - 14:00
 - Wednesday  **30/10/2024**,  14:00 - 18:00

Lectures will be in two locations 
(close to each other, both in **Reggio Emilia, San Lazzaro Campus**):
 - on both Wednesdays, 23rd and 30th:   **room F1.3** of the [Buccola-Bisi Pavillion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B7RUghyqtGYQMbc69)
 - on Friday, 25th:  **lab G1.2** of the [Tamburini Pavillion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/88nZ1KWApgovJiuY9)

You are *not required* to bring with you your own laptop 
to do exercises or follow along, 
but can of course bring it 
to take notes and browse slides yourself.

**Remote participation IS NOT ALLOWED**, 
except for exceptional circumstances that should be motivated and agreed upon with me. 
[Send me an email](mailto:stefano.mariani@unimore.it) in case.

# Syllabus

I do not assume *any background knowledge* of 
game theory, 
Reinforcement Learning (RL) 
or Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), 
nor obviously of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). 

The course is meant to provide attendants 
with basic knowledge about 
concepts, techniques, and technologies 
used specifically in MARL. 
For doing so, introducing concepts of RL and game theory 
is be a necessary prerequisite. 
At the end of the course, 
attendants **are not** expected to be proficient 
in modelling, solving, and analysing performance 
of RL and/or MARL problems. 
However, attendants are expected to 
**understand the terminology** 
and whether RL and/or MARL can provide solutions to their own research problems. 
This way, attendants become able to 
**autonomously carry out further research** 
to expand their knowledge of RL and MARL, 
as applied to their own research field.

Lectures will cover the following topics:
 - the basics of RL
 - from RL to MARL
 - roots in game theory
 - solution concepts
 - learning (computing solutions)
 - deep MARL in brief
 - communication in MARL
 - software libraries

# Exam: quiz

Students enrolled in the course can choose to take the final examination as a quiz.
The quiz will feature **10 questions, 8 in multiple choice form, 2 in open answer** form, to be answered in **30 minutes**.
The quiz yields "success/failure", no numeric score.
*To succeed, students need to correctly answer 4 multiple choices and 1 open answer.*

The pool of eligible questions is as follows:

**Multiple choice**
 - Which are the core features defining a software agent?
 - What is theoretical reasoning?
 - What is practical reasoning?
 - Which are the abstractions of the BDI model?
 - Which are the most common agent architectures?
 - Which are the properties that adaptiveness brings to a system?
 - What is a dominant strategy?
 - What are zero-sum games?
 - What is Nash equilibrium?
 - Which are the forms of interaction in a multiagent system?
 - Which are the types of interaction in a multiagent system?
 - What is the core mechanism that makes tuple spaces suitable for coordinating interactions?
 - Which are the existing technologies cleverly combined by the blockchain?
 - What does it mean to mine blocks?
 - Which properties should a digital signature guarantee?
 - Which properties should consensus guarantee?
 - According to FLP theorem, which are the two properties you have to choose amongst in case of failures?
 - According to CAP theorem, which are the two properties you have to choose amongst in case of network partitions?
 - What is eventual consistency?
 - What is a Byzantine failure?

**Open questions**
 - What is the intentional stance?
 - What does Newell's principle of rationality say?
 - What is adaptiveness?
 - What is a multiagent system?
 - What is game theory in a nutshell?
 - What is an interaction protocol?
 - What are the differences between ContractNet and auctions?
 - What is the problem of distributed consensus?
